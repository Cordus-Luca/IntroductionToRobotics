Technical Task: Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the
  colors of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done
  with digital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiometer 
  with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the led.

Components: 5 LEDs, 1 button, 1 buzzer, resistors and wires (per logic)

Tehnical Task: Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk. You
will use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green)
and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green).

Components: 1 7-segment display, 1 joystick, resistors and wires (per logic)

Tehnical Task: You will use the joystick to control the position of
the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments
should be natural (meaning they should jump from the current position
only to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”.

# Homework 4

Tehnical Task: Use the joystick to move through the 4 digit 7
segment displays digits, press the button to lock in on the current digit
and use the other axis to increment or decrement the number. Keep the
button pressed to reset all the digit values and the current position to the
first digit in the first state.
